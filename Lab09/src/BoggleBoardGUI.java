  Title: Boggle Board
  Course: CSCE 270
  Lab Section: 01
  Semester: Spring 2011
  Instructor: David Wolff
  Date: the 5/2/2011
  Sources consulted: Dr.Wolff, Matt, Java Doc and

  Program description: This program will read a text file to generate the
  boggle board and the user can play with it. This program has three main
  part: Boggle Board (main program), GUI, and Dictionary. User can play both
  GUI and Boggle Board. Two parts use recursion: binary search in Dictionary and
  boggleSolver in BoggleBoard. GUI uses buttons to represent grids.
  Known Bugs: [SOLVED]When input more than one word, the program will not return
  correct answer BUT this bug has been avoided by creating a new boggleBoard. 
  And it works well. So, no bugs left.
  Creativity: A GUI for the program. It uses dialog windows to interact with the 
  user. It provides the same quality as the one provided by non-GUI program.
  In creativity part, the UI will change according to the "board.txt". This is a 
  major progress in my programming career. I also use a function to make sure 
  in most cases the fonts will be clearly displayed on the button. It's a GUI, but
  more than a GUI.

/**
 * This program is the GUI for boggleBoard. In this program the 
 * units of the board are replaced by buttons. The only reason
 * I did this is because I think JButton has better looking and
 * when you feel that you can click on them (although there is no
 * operation will be implemented), it becomes even better. The 
 * GUI can handle 4x4 or higher size of the board. I try to make 
 * the font looks good by establish a function relates both the 
 * sideLength and font size. So, in most cases, the fonts should 
 * look good but I only test 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7 and 8x8. The 
 * function may not keep the font size good in all the situations,
 * but in most normal situation it should work. All the interactions
 * between the user and the program are carried by pop-up dialog.
 * The GUI will not prompt the user to input the next word by pop-up
 * a dialog window 'cause it doesn't make sense to let user click 
 * one more time. But the GUI does notify the user to do the next
 * word inputing implicitly by cleaning up the text field in which
 * the user inputs the word.
